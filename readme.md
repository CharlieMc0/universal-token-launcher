## Overview

The Universal Token Launcher simplifies token deployment by allowing token creators to:
- Configure token details (name, icon, decimals, total supply)
- Upload a CSV file for initial token distributions (address, chain ID, token amount)
- Pay a fixed ZETA fee with a single signed transaction

Token holders can view their balances and bridge tokens between chains with a one-click interface.
