# Universal Token Launcher Frontend

This project is the frontend for the Universal Token Launcher, which allows users to deploy and move tokens and NFTs across multiple blockchains using ZetaChain's cross-chain technology.

## âœ¨ UI/UX Enhancement Initiative (In Progress)

We've implemented several design and UX enhancements to create a premium, intuitive experience:

### Rebranding & Navigation
- **Simplified Navigation**: Reduced to just two primary actions ("Make" and "Move") for a cleaner, more focused experience
- **Action-Oriented Language**: Changed terminology from "Create/Transfer" to "Make/Move" for more intuitive user interaction
- **Minimalist Header**: Streamlined header with just logo, navigation, and wallet connection

### Visual Refinements
- **Premium Dark Theme**: Implemented a darker color scheme (#080810) with vibrant accent colors for better visual hierarchy
- **Subtle Animations**: Added smooth transitions (250-300ms easing) for all interactive elements
- **Monospace Typography**: Using JetBrains Mono font for addresses, transaction hashes, and amounts
- **8px Grid System**: Applied a consistent 8px spacing system throughout the app
- **Gradient Accents**: Added gradient backgrounds to primary action buttons
- **Refined Separators**: Using thin dividers (1px) with low opacity for subtle visual separation

### Enhanced Component Design
- **Visual Cards**: Replaced toggle buttons with visual cards for token/NFT type selection
- **Improved Form Elements**: Better focus states, validation feedback, and interactive elements
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized layouts, spacing, and interactive behaviors

### Interaction Improvements
- **Reduced Friction**: Combined or eliminated unnecessary steps in main workflows
- **Better Feedback**: Enhanced loading states, success/error feedback, and transaction status visibility
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show advanced options only when needed

## Backend Integration

The frontend integrates with a backend server running on port 8000. The integration is handled through the `apiService.js` file, which provides methods for:

- Creating and deploying tokens across multiple chains
- Retrieving token information and deployment logs
- Transferring tokens between chains
- Loading user token balances

### API Endpoints

The application uses the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/chains` - Get supported chains information
- `POST /api/deploy` - Deploy token across multiple chains, also used for fee payment confirmation
- `GET /api/token/{identifier}` - Get token details by ID or contract address
- `GET /api/users/{address}` - Get tokens owned by user
- `POST /api/verify` - Verify deployed contracts

### API Integration Updates

The API integration has been updated to align with the backend's actual API structure:

1. **Correct Endpoint Paths**
   - Updated to use the OpenAPI-documented endpoints like `/api/token/{identifier}` instead of `/api/tokens/{id}`
   - Fixed the deployment endpoint to use `/api/deploy` for both creation and fee confirmation
   - Updated user tokens endpoint to use `/api/users/{address}`

2. **Data Format Standardization**
   - Ensured proper handling of snake_case from backend vs camelCase in frontend
   - Added field name conversion to maintain consistency
   - Improved error handling for validation errors
   - Fixed data type handling (decimals as integers, amounts as strings)

3. **Token Deployment Flow**
   - Updated to match the backend's expected workflow:
     - Create token configuration via `/api/deploy`
     - Process fee payment transaction
     - Confirm fee payment with token_id and fee_paid_tx
     - Poll token status using `/api/token/{identifier}`

4. **Chain Information Processing**
   - Enhanced extraction of connected chain data from API responses
   - Properly combines ZetaChain and other chain information
   - Handles both standalone and nested chain data formats
   - Added robust handling for missing or undefined fields with fallbacks
   - Ensures all chain info entries have valid chainId, name, and contractAddress values

5. **Error Handling and Validation**
   - Improved extraction of validation errors from API responses
   - Better formatting of error messages for users
   - Enhanced retry and polling logic for network errors
   - Added specific handling for different HTTP error codes
   - Ensured all required fields are included in each API call

### API Data Format

The API service automatically converts between frontend's camelCase and backend's snake_case:

```javascript
// Example conversion in deployUniversalToken
const apiData = {
  token_name: tokenData.token_name, 
  token_symbol: tokenData.token_symbol,
  decimals: tokenData.decimals,
  total_supply: tokenData.total_supply,
  selected_chains: tokenData.selected_chains,
  deployer_address: tokenData.deployer_address,
  allocations: tokenData.allocations
};
```

### Error Handling

The API service now includes enhanced error handling:

```javascript
// Error handler helper with validation error formatting
if (error.response?.data?.detail && Array.isArray(error.response.data.detail)) {
  // Format validation errors in a user-friendly way
  const validationErrors = error.response.data.detail.map(err => {
    const field = err.loc[err.loc.length-1];
    return `${field}: ${err.msg}`;
  }).join('; ');
  
  console.error('Validation errors:', error.response.data.detail);
  throw new Error(`Validation error: ${validationErrors}`);
}
```

### Token Response Processing

The API service processes the token response data to make it compatible with the frontend:

```javascript
// Process connected chains information - combine both sources
let chainInfo = [];

// Add ZetaChain info if present
if (data.token.zeta_chain_info) {
  chainInfo.push({
    ...data.token.zeta_chain_info,
    isZetaChain: true,
    chainId: data.token.zeta_chain_info.chainId || '7001',
    name: data.token.zeta_chain_info.name || 'ZetaChain'
  });
}

// Add connected chains if present
if (data.token.connected_chains_json && typeof data.token.connected_chains_json === 'object') {
  // Process each chain and ensure required fields exist
  const connectedChains = Object.entries(data.token.connected_chains_json).map(([chainId, chainData]) => {
    return {
      ...chainData,
      chainId: chainId || 'unknown',
      name: chainData.name || `Chain ${chainId}`,
      deploymentStatus: chainData.status || 'unknown'
    };
  });
  
  chainInfo = [...chainInfo, ...connectedChains];
}

// Ensure all chain info has required fields
chainInfo = chainInfo.map(chain => ({
  ...chain,
  chainId: chain.chainId || 'unknown',
  name: chain.name || `Chain ${chain.chainId || 'Unknown'}`,
  deploymentStatus: chain.deploymentStatus || chain.status || 'unknown',
  contractAddress: chain.contract_address || chain.contractAddress || 'Address not available'
}));

// Add the processed chainInfo to token
data.token.chainInfo = chainInfo;
```

## Transaction Handling

The application includes robust transaction handling for token deployment:

### Transaction Features

- **Progressive Status Updates:** Shows step-by-step progress during token creation, fee payment, transaction confirmation, backend deployment initiation, and status polling.
- **Transaction Retry:** Provides a retry button when fee payment transactions fail, with up to 3 retry attempts.
- **Clear Error Messages:** Displays detailed error information for transaction failures, confirmation timeouts, and backend deployment failures.
- **Immediate Token ID Display:** Shows token ID as soon as the configuration is created.
- **Wallet Connection Verification:** Ensures wallet is connected before attempting transactions.
- **Chain ID Specification:** Explicitly sets chain ID to ensure fee transactions happen on the correct network (ZetaChain).
- **Transaction Hash Display:** Shows the fee payment transaction hash with a link to ZetaChain block explorer.
- **Wallet Readiness Check:** Verifies wallet client is fully initialized before attempting transactions.
- **Resilient Transaction Confirmation:** Implements a robust retry mechanism with progressive delays to handle blockchain timing issues.
- **Advanced Receipt Polling:** Automatically retries transaction receipt retrieval with increasing timeouts to prevent `TransactionReceiptNotFoundError` issues.
- **Deployment Status Polling:** After initiating deployment with the backend, the frontend polls periodically to check the final deployment status (`completed` or `failed`).
- **Deployment Confirmation Display:** Renders a detailed confirmation view (`DeploymentConfirmation` component) upon successful completion, showing deployed contracts, chains, verification status, and explorer links.

### Transaction Confirmation

The application now features an improved transaction confirmation process:

```javascript
// Transaction confirmation function with retries
const confirmTransaction = async (txHash) => {
  let confirmed = false;
  let attempts = 0;
  const maxAttempts = 20; // Maximum number of attempts
  
  while (!confirmed && attempts < maxAttempts) {
    try {
      attempts++;
      console.log(`Attempting to get transaction receipt (Attempt ${attempts}/${maxAttempts})...`);
      
      // Update UI with progress
      setProcessingStep(`Waiting for transaction confirmation... (Attempt ${attempts}/${maxAttempts})`);
      
      // Add increasing delay between attempts
      const delayMs = Math.min(2000 + (attempts * 1000), 10000); // Start with 2s, increase by 1s each try, max 10s
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs));
      
      // Try to get the transaction receipt
      let receipt = null;
      
      try {
        // Try to get the transaction receipt directly
        receipt = await publicClient.getTransactionReceipt({ hash: txHash });
        
        if (receipt && receipt.status === 'success') {
          console.log('Transaction confirmed successfully!', receipt);
          setProcessingStep('Transaction confirmed successfully!');
          return receipt; // Success!
        } else if (receipt && receipt.status === 'reverted') {
          setProcessingStep('Transaction was reverted on-chain');
          throw new Error('Transaction was reverted on-chain');
        } else if (receipt) {
          // If we get here, receipt exists but status is not success - wait and try again
          console.log(`Receipt found but status not success. Current status: ${receipt?.status || 'unknown'}`);
          setProcessingStep(`Transaction processing... Current status: ${receipt?.status || 'unknown'}`);
        }
      } catch (receiptError) {
        console.log('Error getting receipt directly:', receiptError.message);
        
        // Check if it's a "receipt not found" error, which is expected early on
        if (receiptError.name === 'TransactionReceiptNotFoundError' || receiptError.message.includes('could not be found')) {
          console.log(`Transaction receipt not found yet (attempt ${attempts}/${maxAttempts}). Waiting...`);
          setProcessingStep(`Transaction not yet mined on ZetaChain... (Attempt ${attempts}/${maxAttempts})`);
        } else {
          // For other errors, log but continue retrying
          console.error(`Error checking transaction (attempt ${attempts}/${maxAttempts}):`, receiptError.message);
          setProcessingStep(`Error checking transaction: ${receiptError.message} (Retrying...)`);
        }
        
        // Only throw on last attempt
        if (attempts >= maxAttempts) {
          setProcessingStep(`Failed to confirm transaction after ${maxAttempts} attempts`);
          throw new Error(`Failed to confirm transaction after ${maxAttempts} attempts: ${receiptError.message}`);
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Only throw on last attempt
      if (attempts >= maxAttempts) {
        setProcessingStep(`Failed to confirm transaction after ${maxAttempts} attempts`);
        throw new Error(`Failed to confirm transaction after ${maxAttempts} attempts: ${error.message}`);
      }
    }
  }
  
  // If we get here, we've run out of attempts
  setProcessingStep(`Transaction confirmation timed out after ${maxAttempts} attempts`);
  throw new Error(`Transaction confirmation timed out after ${maxAttempts} attempts`);
};
```

### Deployment UI Improvements

The DeploymentConfirmation component has been enhanced to handle edge cases:

- **Robust Key Generation:** Prevents React "duplicate key" warnings by using unique identifiers for each chain entry
- **Fallback Values:** Provides graceful handling for missing or undefined chain information
- **Error State Display:** Clearly displays error states for failed deployments
- **Explorer Links:** Shows block explorer links only when they are available
- **Status Indicators:** Uses different icons and colors for various deployment states

## Transaction Workflow

1. **Pre-Transaction Validation:**
   - Ensures wallet is properly connected.
   - Verifies user is on ZetaChain network.
   - Confirms wallet client is fully ready.
   - Validates form inputs.

2. **Token Configuration Creation:**
   - Frontend calls `POST /api/deploy` with configuration data in snake_case format.
   - Backend creates the token configuration and returns the `deployment_id`.

3. **Fee Payment Transaction:**
   - Frontend prompts user to sign the fee payment transaction (1 ZETA to service wallet).
   - Clearly communicates waiting for wallet signature.
   - Prepares transaction parameters with explicit `chainId` (ZetaChain).
   - Handles common error scenarios (user rejection, insufficient funds).

4. **On-Chain Transaction Confirmation:**
   - Displays fee transaction hash immediately after submission.
   - Shows block explorer link for transaction tracking.
   - Implements a robust retry mechanism with progressive delays.
   - Handles confirmation timeouts, transaction replacements, or reverted transactions.

5. **Backend Deployment Initiation:**
   - After fee transaction confirmation, frontend calls `POST /api/deploy` with the token_id, fee_paid_tx hash, and all required token data fields.
   - Backend starts the asynchronous contract deployment process.

6. **Deployment Status Polling:**
   - Frontend enters a polling state (`useEffect` hook).
   - Periodically calls `GET /api/token/{identifier}` to check the `deployment_status` field.
   - Updates UI with messages like "Backend is deploying contracts...".

7. **Deployment Completion/Failure:**
   - **If status becomes `completed`:**
     - Polling stops.
     - Frontend extracts chain information from the token response.
     - Frontend renders the `DeploymentConfirmation` component with the chain data.
   - **If status becomes `failed`:**
     - Polling stops.
     - Frontend extracts error details from the response.
     - Frontend displays an error message indicating deployment failure.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### API Integration Issues

If you encounter API integration issues:

1. **404 Not Found Errors**
   - Check the endpoint paths: all API endpoints should start with `/api/`
   - Ensure you're using the correct format: `/api/token/{id}` not `/api/tokens/{id}`
   - Verify the backend is running on the expected port (8000 by default)

2. **422 Unprocessable Entity Errors**
   - These indicate validation errors from the backend
   - Make sure to use snake_case for all API request fields: `token_name` not `tokenName`
   - Ensure all required fields are included (`token_name`, `token_symbol`, `selected_chains`, `deployer_address`)
   - Verify types are correct: numbers as integers, large values like `total_supply` as strings
   - Check the browser console for detailed validation errors

3. **Data Format Issues**
   - Backend requires snake_case format (`token_name` not `tokenName`)
   - All chain IDs must be strings (like "7001" not 7001)
   - Token amounts must be strings for large numbers
   - ZetaChain must be included in `selected_chains`

4. **Transaction Confirmation Issues**
   - Look for `TransactionReceiptNotFoundError` errors, which indicate timing issues
   - Check that the transaction confirmation retry mechanism is working correctly
   - Verify the transaction was actually submitted to the blockchain
   - Ensure the wallet is connected to the correct network (ZetaChain Athens)

5. **Deployment UI Issues**
   - If you see "Duplicate key" React warnings, check the key generation in the DeploymentConfirmation component
   - For "undefined" chain IDs or names, verify the API response data processing in getToken
   - Make sure chainInfo has properly processed the data from connected_chains_json

6. **Debugging Tips**
   - Look at browser console logs for detailed API requests and responses
   - Check the error response details for validation errors
   - Verify that all required fields are present in API requests
   - Test API endpoints directly using tools like curl or Postman

### API Response Structure

The token API endpoint returns data structured like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": {
    "id": 1,
    "token_name": "Test Token",
    "token_symbol": "TST",
    "decimals": 18,
    "total_supply": "1000000000000000000000000",
    "deployment_status": "completed",
    "error_message": null,
    "deployer_address": "0x4f1684A28E33F42cdf50AB96e29a709e17249E63",
    "zc_contract_address": "0x7c9037d10c4BC877268cb4fe900490Ff98b5D52b",
    "connected_chains_json": {
      "11155111": {
        "status": "completed",
        "contract_address": "0x8Da98E1ea986331D68ee5CD83b1E49665B4587fB",
        "transaction_hash": "0x...",
        "verification_status": "pending",
        "chain_id": "11155111",
        "chain_name": "Sepolia Testnet",
        "explorer_url": "https://sepolia.etherscan.io",
        "blockscout_url": null,
        "contract_url": "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8Da98E1ea986331D68ee5CD83b1E49665B4587fB"
      }
    },
    "zeta_chain_info": {
      "chain_id": "7001",
      "contract_address": "0x7c9037d10c4BC877268cb4fe900490Ff98b5D52b",
      "status": "completed",
      "explorer_url": "https://explorer.athens.zetachain.com",
      "blockscout_url": "https://zetachain-testnet.blockscout.com/",
      "verification_status": "unknown",
      "contract_url": "https://zetachain-testnet.blockscout.com//address/0x7c9037d10c4BC877268cb4fe900490Ff98b5D52b"
    }
  }
}
```

## Cross-Chain Moves and Contract Interactions

The application includes robust cross-chain token movement functionality through direct contract interactions with Universal Tokens.

### Cross-Chain Move Features

- **Network Verification**: Ensures the user is on the correct blockchain network (ZetaChain) before initiating moves
- **Gas Estimation**: Accurate gas estimation for cross-chain transactions
- **Balance Verification**: Checks token balance before attempting moves to prevent failed transactions
- **Contract Setup Verification**: **NEW:** Before attempting a move, the app now checks if the necessary cross-chain contract addresses (`connectedContracts` on ZetaChain, `zetaChainContract` on EVM chains) are properly set up by the owner. This prevents moves from failing due to incomplete setup.
- **Fallback ABI Mechanism**: Uses fallback ABI if standard one fails, improving compatibility with different contract versions
- **Dynamic Gas Estimation**: Estimates gas directly from the contract with a 30% buffer for safety
- **Transaction Retries**: Automatically retries failed transactions with increased gas (50% more) when appropriate
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Provides user-friendly error messages for common issues like insufficient funds or balance, and **NEW:** errors related to incomplete contract setup.
- **Signer Validation**: Verifies wallet connection and signer availability at multiple checkpoints
- **Better Decimals Handling**: Properly handles token decimals for amount formatting to prevent precision errors

### Minting Functionality (NEW)

- **Conditional Minting**: The UI now displays a "Mint" tab alongside "Move" if the connected wallet:
  - Is the original deployer/owner of the selected token contract.
  - OR has a balance greater than 0 for the selected token on the chosen source chain.
- **Mint Form**: Allows the deployer/owner (or eligible user) to specify the amount to mint and an optional recipient address (defaults to their own address).
- **Mint Transaction**: Uses the `mintTokens` function with robust gas estimation, fallback logic, and error handling similar to the move function.
- **Permissions Check**: Ensures only the authorized owner can execute the mint transaction on-chain.

### Contract Interaction Improvements

- **Provider Chain Verification**: Uses `provider.getNetwork().chainId` with proper type conversion for Ethers.js v6 compatibility
- **BigInt Safety**: Uses `ethers.toBigInt()` instead of global `BigInt` for better compatibility across browsers
- **Enhanced Error Diagnostics**: Includes comprehensive error details for easier debugging of transaction failures
- **Function Availability Checks**: Verifies contract methods exist before attempting to call them
- **Wait Time Optimization**: Uses appropriate wait periods between network switching and transactions
- **Safe Contract Method Access**: Checks interface and method availability with proper null/undefined handling
- **Contract Verification**: Validates contracts by testing basic methods before attempting complex operations
- **Mint Gas Handling**: **NEW:** Implemented robust gas estimation and retry logic for the `mint` function, similar to the `crossChainMove` function, resolving previous gas-related errors.

### Error Handling and Recovery

- **Network Mismatch Handling**: Detects and resolves network mismatches between wallet and required chain
- **Revert Reason Extraction**: Attempts to extract and display meaningful error messages from transaction reverts
- **Transaction Status Checking**: Verifies transaction success and handles on-chain failed transactions
- **Modular Error Management**: Separates error handling logic for cleaner code and better user feedback
- **Wallet Connection Issues**: Checks for wallet availability and connectivity before transactions
- **Parameters Validation**: Validates and properly formats all transaction parameters before sending
- **Console Diagnostics**: Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting in the browser console
- **Incomplete Setup Errors**: **NEW:** Clearly informs the user if a move fails because the token's cross-chain setup (linking contracts) hasn't been completed by the owner.

### Common Cross-Chain Move Issues

1.  **"Token setup incomplete..." Errors**
    - **NEW:** This error indicates the contract owner hasn't finished setting up the cross-chain links (`connectedContracts` or `zetaChainContract`). The owner must call the appropriate setup function (`setConnectedContract` or `setZetaChainContract`) on the deployed contracts.
    - Check the console logs for specific details about which link is missing.
2.  **"Cannot convert undefined or null to object"**
    - Check that the contract ABI is properly defined and accessible
    - Verify the contract address is correct and accessible on the current network
    - Enable console logging to see where the null object is occurring
3.  **Transaction Revert Errors**
    - Look for specific revert messages in the error details
    - Check token balance to ensure sufficient tokens for the move
    - Verify that the recipient address is correctly formatted
    - Ensure the destination chain ID is supported by the contract
4.  **Network Switching Issues**
    - Make sure the wallet (MetaMask) has ZetaChain configured
    - Check for wallet permission issues when switching networks
    - Allow sufficient time for network switching to complete before proceeding
5.  **Gas Estimation Failures**
    - If gas estimation fails, the application will use a fallback estimate
    - Consider manually increasing gas in MetaMask if transactions consistently fail
    - Check wallet balance for sufficient ZETA to cover gas costs
6.  **Minting Errors**
    - **NEW:** "Only the token owner..." error means the connected wallet doesn't have permission to mint.
    - **NEW:** Ensure the mint amount and recipient address are valid.
    - Gas errors during minting should be less common now due to improved estimation and retries.

## Latest Enhancements

- **Enhanced Move Page**:
  - Redesigned Move page with a compact token card layout and an improved user interface.
  - New components introduced: `EnhancedTokenCard`, `TokenSectionContainer`, `TokenFilterControls`, and `EnhancedMovePanel` to streamline token moves.
  - Updated filter tabs to display "Tokens You Made" and "Tokens You Hold".
  - Automatic Source Chain Selection: When a user has tokens on only one chain with a non-zero balance, that chain is auto-selected, reducing manual input and enhancing usability.
  - Fixed bug where the Move/Mint window would disappear when switching between tabs.

- **API Update**:
  - Modified the `getUserTokens` function to include a `created_at` field, improving sorting and filtering of tokens.

- **Enabled Status**: Only chains marked as `enabled: true` in the API can be selected
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If the API is unavailable, predetermined chains are shown with an error notice
- **Testnet Filtering**: Only testnet chains are displayed by default

#### User Experience
- **Sorting Logic**: Chains are logically sorted with ZetaChain first, then enabled chains, then disabled chains
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive tiles have subtle hover effects for better user feedback
- **Error Messages**: Clear error messages are displayed when chain selection requirements aren't met
- **Placeholder Handling**: Graceful handling of missing chain logos with placeholder images

## NFT Deployment Enhancements

The NFT deployment functionality has been improved with several important updates:

### Backend Integration Fixes

- **Fixed Chain Loading**: Resolved issue where "Loading supported chains..." would remain indefinitely by enhancing chain data filtering, adding proper error handling, and implementing better state management.
- **Proper API Integration**: Updated the NFT deployment flow to correctly integrate with the backend API endpoint (`/api/nft/deploy`), removing the unnecessary frontend-initiated fee payment transaction and confirmation steps.
- **Streamlined Deployment Process**: Simplified the deployment flow to:
  1. Send NFT collection data directly to the backend API in one call
  2. Poll for deployment status until completion
  3. Display deployment details upon successful completion

### User Experience Improvements

- **Image Validation**: Made image upload optional for form submission since the image isn't actually sent to the backend API.
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved validation error messages and feedback to provide clearer guidance to users.
- **Deployment Status Feedback**: Enhanced the polling mechanism to provide real-time updates on deployment progress.
- **Robust Chain Selection**: Implemented fallback chains and better filtering for testnet-only chains to ensure users can always access ZetaChain.

### Code Quality Enhancements

- **Dependency Management**: Corrected the useEffect dependency array to prevent unnecessary chain re-fetching.
- **Better Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the deployment process to aid debugging.
- **Input Validation**: Improved validation for input fields including checksummed Ethereum addresses.
- **Clean State Management**: Added proper cleanup of state variables between deployment attempts.

These improvements ensure that the NFT deployment functionality works reliably with the backend API, providing users with a seamless experience for deploying NFT collections across multiple chains.
