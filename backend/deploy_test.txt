# Universal Token Deployment Testing

## Option 1: Direct Deployment + Separate Initialize (Still has issues)
# Example test run output for two-step approach
python ./test_direct_deployment.py

## Option 2: One-Step Deployment (Has constructor issues)
# Attempts to perform deployment and initialization in a single transaction
python ./test_one_step_deployment.py

## Option 3: Fixed Deployment Script (RECOMMENDED)
# Fixed deployment that handles the known issues and provides detailed logging
python ./deploy_token_fixed.py

# To deploy on a specific chain, provide the chain ID as an argument:
# python ./deploy_token_fixed.py 11155111   # Sepolia
# python ./deploy_token_fixed.py 7001       # ZetaChain
